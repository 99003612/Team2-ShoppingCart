**About**

This is a demo project of full-stack Online Shop web application using Spring Boot 4 and Hibernate 5. The main idea was to build a basic shopping cart web app for Grocery Shopping. So here, we tried implementing front-end and linking it with back-end.

**Prerequisites**

- HTML, CSS

**Configuration Files**

Folder src/resources, contains config files for Shopping Cart Spring Boot application.
- src/resources/application.propeties
- main configuration file. One can change username and password here along with port number.
